Krawall TODO

- Check if it's working on real hardware

- Look into devkitPro's crt0 and make sure that 
  a) multiple interrupts are possible and
  b) IRQ_TIMER1 is not interrupted by any other interrupt
  (Otherwise, there may be audible clicks)

- Figure out why -O3 results in a non-working library
